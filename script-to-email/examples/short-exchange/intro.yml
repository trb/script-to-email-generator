              Hi there,
              
              I'm looking for a childrens playground set, and I saw your catalogue
              on your website. I'm really interested in the Pine model, would you be
              able to offer some customizations?

              Hi Sue,
              
              thank you for reaching out to us. We're certainly able to produce a
              customized Pine model for you. We do have a customization fee in
              addition to the actual work hours required to meet your specifications.
              
              If you'd like to move forward, you can send us details about your
              customization request and I will work with our engineering department
              to create a custom invoice for you.
              
              Best,

              Hi Alex,
              
              that sounds good to me. I'll talk to my husband and we'll get you some
              specifics in a bit.
              
              Have a great weekend,

          Hi Alex,
          
          please see the attached PDF for details on what we look for in the
          customization. Can you give us an idea of the cost and when we
          can expect delivery?
          
          Best,
          
          Sue
