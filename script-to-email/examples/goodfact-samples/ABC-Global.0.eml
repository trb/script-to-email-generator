Hi Clive,
I have a company interested in the Widgets part of our cloud software.
It is company processing widgets for their client companies (they have hundre=
ds of clients).
I met with the owner and I think that our International Widgets will do what =
they need. Initially it looks like they would need around 10 users.
The company is in Calgary. The owner would like to have a meeting with us to =
discuss the contract at Thursday/Friday this or next week.
I am in the office now =E2=80=93 extension 283, or my cell -. Please email me=
 or call me so we can discuss this.
Thank you
John
