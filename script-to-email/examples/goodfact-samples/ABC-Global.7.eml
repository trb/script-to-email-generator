We cannot combine the services estimates with the license fees on the sales o=
rder. As mentioned during our discussions last week, our fiscal year end is M=
ay 31st and the accommodations we have been making to you along the way regar=
ding terms and license fees, have been based upon the premise that we will ha=
ve a signed sales order by may 31st. In the meantime I will urge Joe to produ=
ce the services estimate for the reports and implementation but again, it wil=
l be separate from the sales order.
Thanks,
Shawn Fine
