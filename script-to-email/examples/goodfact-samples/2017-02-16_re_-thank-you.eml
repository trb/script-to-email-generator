Hi Clive,
I talked again with Barbara this week. She again said that she likes our syst=
em and would like to work with us. In the beginning she will just have 5 user=
s, during the first year increasing to 10. Her company ACME is providing widg=
ets services for small size companies in Canada using her own in-house system=
. Currently ACME has approximately 400 client companies with total about 15,0=
00 employees. ACME client companies are submitting requests by email, mail, p=
hone or online. Currently no more than 5% of ACME clients need online access =
to the system for entering the requests and viewing the reports. During the m=
eeting with Barbara at ABC on January 30 with Joe, Andy and yourself we didn=
=E2=80=99t see any problems that would prevent our system to provide what ACM=
E needs. There will be some customisation required: dashboard providing the o=
verview of the payrun status for all ACME clients. We also need to resolve li=
censing for those ACME clients who will require online access (very limited =
=E2=80=93 some reports, timesheet entry and maybe limited employee maintenanc=
e). I discussed this with Gord and he was going to talk about the licensing f=
ees with Shawn and with you. Security is a big concern for ACME, but the ABC =
system should be able to handle the security requirements. Regarding Go-Live:=
 ACME does not plan to start with all clients right away, initially starting =
with no more than 10 clients. I think that our contract with ACME should incl=
ude the following:
  =E2=80=A2 Modules:
    =E2=97=A6 Widgets
    =E2=97=A6 General Ledger
  =E2=80=A2 ACME Users
  =E2=97=A6 5 users
  =E2=80=A2 Client Users
  =E2=97=A6 ??? =E2=80=93 this is where we need to determine the licensing an=
d prices
  =E2=97=A6 Maybe we can say something like this: =E2=80=9CThe customer has t=
he option to purchase additional =E2=80=9Cclient user=E2=80=9D licenses at th=
e =E2=80=9C???=E2=80=9D price
  =E2=80=A2 Software modification
  =E2=97=A6 Customized Dashboard
