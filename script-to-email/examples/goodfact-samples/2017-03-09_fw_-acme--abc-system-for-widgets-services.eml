John,
Just so you know, I spoke to this lady, but it doesn=E2=80=99t look like she =
generates enough revenue to pay for any system at all. Based on the numbers s=
he gave me, she is only generating $200,000 per year TOTAL. We would need any=
 contract to do what she wants us to do to be at least $5000/month. It doesn=
=E2=80=99t look like there=E2=80=99s much chance of that =E2=80=93 unless she=
=E2=80=99s misrepresenting her revenues. It=E2=80=99s in Shawn=E2=80=99s hand=
s to see if he can get her to sign up at that price. BTW =E2=80=93 for $5000/=
month she would be getting no mods, and she would be responsible for setting =
up the Security within a single Tenant to make it work herself.
Thanks,
Gord
