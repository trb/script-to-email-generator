Working on the revised language now. An issue is that we don=E2=80=99t know t=
he actual number of reports until the year is over, but they have to pay for =
the next year by the last day of the year. So if there is a credit, we won=E2=
=80=99t know the credit amount until after they are supposed to have already =
paid and we won=E2=80=99t be able to give an accurate invoice 60 days prior t=
o the end of the year.
Perhaps we have to add another term on the SO that says notwithstanding the M=
SA, we will issue the invoice 60 days before the end of the Term, but it will=
 be subject to any credits that will be determined after the end of the year =
and, provided that they have notified us of their intention to renew, their p=
ayment for the next term won=E2=80=99t be due until 10 days into that new ter=
m as opposed to on the last day of the expiring term?
Let me know what you think.
Thanks.
Matt
