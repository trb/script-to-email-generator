Hi John,
The meeting did not go well because she was extremely belligerent to Ryan and=
 Janet. Her behavior was completely inappropriate and borderline abusive, so =
before we decide on any course of action he needs to calm down and follow our=
 appropriate sales cycle. We don=E2=80=99t have the expertise in the Solution=
s group to study his widgets requirements, it will have to be someone who act=
ually implements the system to let us know if we can accommodate his requirem=
ents. I would imagine either Melissa or Andy could make that determination. O=
nce someone has completed that assessment and has told us our system can hand=
le it the process will be as follows,
1. We will have a call to determine his user count in order to give her the a=
ppropriate proposal.
2. Upon approval of the software and implementation estimate we will then do =
a demonstration of our solution at ABC=E2=80=99s office and discuss any poten=
tial
customization. In the event we need to bring in a consultant to discuss speci=
fics it will be a lot easier if we=E2=80=99re at the office.
I=E2=80=99m out of the office on vacation until January 9th. I suggest you se=
e who can take a look at the document to determine if we can handle it. Let m=
e know who that
is and I=E2=80=99ll coordinate with them when I get back from my vacation.
Thanks,
Clive Robertson
