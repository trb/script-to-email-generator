Hi Barbara,
I would like to send you a quick update regarding next steps and the demonstr=
ation of our Widgets part of the system to you.
1. I will be working with our expert Widgets consultants to analyze the docum=
ent with your requirements that you gave me. We will prepare a demonstration =
of our Widgets system to you based on this analysis. I believe that we should=
 have the analysis ready in the first half of January 2017.
2. We will have a meeting or a call with you prior to the demonstration to de=
termine your user count in order to give you the appropriate proposal.
3. When ready, we will do a demonstration of our solution at ABC=E2=80=99s of=
fice and discuss any potential
customization. We will have to arrange a time based on your availability and =
on the availability of our Widgets consultants.
Please email me or call me any time if you have any comments or questions.
Thank you very much for your consideration.
Best regards,
John
